TASK:API
Weather API CLI Tool
1. Introduction
In this task, I created a simple command-line tool in Python to fetch real-time weather information of a given city.
The program uses an external Weather API and displays details like temperature, weather condition, and wind speed.

2. API Used
I used the WeatherAPI.com service: https://www.weatherapi.com
The API requires a key for authentication.
Data is returned in JSON format, which the program parses to extract useful information.
3. Working of the CLI Tool
The user enters the city name as an argument when running the script.
The tool sends an HTTP request to the WeatherAPI service.
The API responds with the current weather information.
The program prints details like:
Location and country
Temperature in Celsius
Weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy)
Wind speed
4. Example Code Snippet
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Simple Weather CLI Tool")
parser.add_argument("--city", required=True, help="City name")
args = parser.parse_args()

get_weather(args.city)

This part of the code ensures that the user must provide a city name when running the program.

## 🌐 TASK: API — Weather CLI Tool

### Introduction
For this task, I developed a command-line weather application using Python.  
The tool fetches real-time weather details for a given city and displays them directly in the terminal.

### API Used
- WeatherAPI.com (https://www.weatherapi.com)
- Authentication using an API key
- JSON responses parsed in Python

### How it Works
- User runs the script with a city name.
- The program sends an HTTP request to the API.
- Weather information is extracted and displayed, including:
  - Location and country
  - Temperature in Celsius
  - Weather condition
  - Wind speed

### Sample Snippet
```python
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Weather CLI Tool")
parser.add_argument("--city", required=True)
args = parser.parse_args()

get_weather(args.city)
